6 Benefits of Cordyceps, All Backed by Science
Cordyceps is a genus of parasitic fungi that grows on the larvae of insects.

When these fungi attack their host, they replace its tissue and sprout long, slender stems that grow outside the host’s body.

The remains of the insect and fungi have been hand-collected, dried and used in Traditional Chinese Medicine for centuries to treat fatigue, sickness, kidney disease and low sex drive.

Supplements and products containing Cordyceps extract have become increasingly popular due to their many purported health benefits.

Of the more than 400 species of Cordyceps discovered, two have become the focus of health research: Cordyceps sinensis and Cordyceps militaris.

However, much of this research is limited to animal or lab studies, so health experts currently can’t draw conclusions about their effects on people.

However, their potential health benefits are promising.

This article highlights 6 potential benefits of Cordyceps, based on science.

1. May Boost Exercise Performance
Cordyceps are thought to increase the body’s production of the molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is essential for delivering energy to the muscles.

This may improve the way your body uses oxygen, especially during exercise (1Trusted Source, 2).

In one study, researchers tested their effects on exercise capacity in 30 healthy older adults using a stationary bike. Participants received either 3 grams per day of a synthetic strain of Cordyceps called CS-4 or a placebo pill for six weeks.

By the end of the study, VO2 max had increased by 7% in participants who had taken CS-4, while participants given the placebo pill showed no change (3).

VO2 max is a measurement used to determine fitness level (4Trusted Source).

In a similar study, 20 healthy older adults received either 1 gram of CS-4 or a placebo pill for 12 weeks (5Trusted Source).

While researchers found no change in VO2 max in either group, participants given CS-4 improved other measures of exercise performance.

One study also tested the effects of a Cordyceps-containing mushroom blend on exercise performance in younger adults (6Trusted Source).

After three weeks, participants’ VO2 max had increased by 11%, compared to a placebo.

However, the current research suggests Cordyceps are not effective at improving exercise performance in trained athletes (7Trusted Source, 8).

SUMMARY
Cordyceps have been shown to improve measures of exercise performance in older and younger adults, but not in well-trained athletes.

2. Anti-Aging Properties
The elderly have traditionally used Cordyceps to reduce fatigue and boost strength and sex drive.

Researchers believe their antioxidant content may explain their anti-aging potential (9Trusted Source).

Several studies have found that Cordyceps increase antioxidants in aged mice, helping improve memory and sexual function (10Trusted Source, 11Trusted Source, 12Trusted Source).

Antioxidants are molecules that fight cell damage by neutralizing free radicals, which can otherwise contribute to disease and aging (13Trusted Source, 14Trusted Source, 15Trusted Source).

One study found that mice that given Cordyceps lived several months longer than mice given a placebo (16).

Another study found that Cordyceps extended the lives of fruit flies, further supporting the belief that they have anti-aging benefits (17Trusted Source).

However, it’s unknown if Cordyceps have these same anti-aging benefits in humans.

SUMMARY
Research in mice suggests Cordyceps have anti-aging properties. While these findings are promising, it’s unknown whether they apply to humans.

3. Potential Anti-Tumor Effects
Cordyceps’ potential to slow the growth of tumors has generated significant interest in recent years.

Researchers believe the fungi may exert anti-tumor effects in several ways.

In test-tube studies, Cordyceps have been shown to inhibit the growth of many types of human cancer cells, including lung, colon, skin and liver cancers (18Trusted Source, 19Trusted Source, 20Trusted Source, 21Trusted Source).

Studies in mice have also shown that Cordyceps have anti-tumor effects on lymphoma, melanoma and lung cancer (22Trusted Source, 23Trusted Source, 24Trusted Source, 25Trusted Source).

Cordyceps may also reverse the side effects associated with many forms of cancer therapy. One of these side effects is leukopenia.

Not to be confused with the cancer leukemia, leukopenia is a condition in which the number of white blood cells (leukocytes) decreases, lowering the body’s defenses and increasing the risk of infection (26Trusted Source).

One study tested the effects of Cordyceps on mice that developed leukopenia after radiation and treatments with Taxol, a common chemotherapy drug (27Trusted Source).

Interestingly, Cordyceps reversed the leukopenia. These results suggest the fungi may help reduce complications associated with some cancer treatments.

However, it’s important to note that these studies were performed in animals and test tubes, not humans.

The effects of Cordyceps on leukopenia and tumor growth in humans is unknown, so health experts can’t currently draw conclusions.

SUMMARY
Test-tube and animal studies suggest Cordyceps may have the potential to treat cancer, as well as some side effects of cancer treatments. However, these effects have not been shown in humans, and more research is needed.


4. May Help Manage Type 2 Diabetes
Cordyceps contain a special type of sugar that may help treat diabetes.

Diabetes is a disease in which the body either does not produce or respond to the hormone insulin, which normally transports the sugar glucose into your cells for energy.

When your body does not produce enough insulin or respond well to it, glucose cannot enter the cells, so it stays in the blood. Over time, having too much glucose in the blood can cause serious health problems.

Therefore, it’s important for people with diabetes to make sure their blood sugar levels are well controlled.

Interestingly, Cordyceps may keep blood sugar levels within a healthy range by mimicking the action of insulin.

In several studies in diabetic mice, Cordyceps have been shown to decrease blood sugar levels (28Trusted Source, 29Trusted Source, 30Trusted Source).

Some evidence suggests that they may also protect against kidney disease, a common complication of diabetes.

In a review of 22 studies including 1,746 people with chronic kidney disease, those who took Cordyceps supplements experienced improved kidney function (31Trusted Source).

However, these results aren’t conclusive. The authors of the review stated that many of the studies were low quality. Therefore, no conclusions could be made about the effects of Cordyceps on kidney function in humans with chronic kidney disease.

SUMMARY
Chronically elevated blood sugar levels are common in people with uncontrolled diabetes and can have serious health effects. Research in animals suggests Cordyceps may have potential as a diabetes treatment.

5. Possible Benefits for Heart Health
As research emerges on the effects of Cordyceps on heart health, the benefits of the fungi are becoming increasingly apparent.

In fact, Cordyceps are approved in China for the treatment of arrhythmia, a condition in which the heartbeat is too slow, too fast or irregular (32Trusted Source).

A study found that Cordyceps significantly reduced heart injuries in rats with chronic kidney disease. Injuries to the heart from chronic kidney disease are thought to increase the risk of heart failure, so reducing these injuries may help avoid this outcome (33Trusted Source).

The researchers attributed these findings to the adenosine content of Cordyceps. Adenosine is a naturally occurring compound that has heart-protective effects (34Trusted Source).

Cordyceps may also have a beneficial effect on cholesterol levels.

Animal research has shown that Cordyceps decrease “bad” LDL cholesterol (35Trusted Source, 36Trusted Source, 37).

LDL can raise your risk of heart disease by leading to the buildup of cholesterol in your arteries.

Similarly, Cordyceps have been shown to decrease triglyceride levels in mice (35Trusted Source).

Triglycerides are a type of fat found in your blood. High levels are linked to a greater risk of heart disease (38Trusted Source).

Unfortunately, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether Cordyceps benefit heart health in humans.

SUMMARY
Cordyceps may benefit heart health by helping prevent arrhythmias and lowering levels of triglycerides and “bad” LDL cholesterol.


6. May Help Fight Inflammation
Cordyceps is said to help fight inflammation in the body.

Although some inflammation is good, too much can lead to diseases like heart disease and cancer.

Research has shown that when human cells are exposed to Cordyceps, special proteins that increase inflammation in the body become suppressed (39Trusted Source, 40Trusted Source, 41Trusted Source, 42Trusted Source).

Thanks to these potential effects, researchers believe Cordyceps may serve as a useful anti-inflammatory supplement or drug (42Trusted Source).

In fact, Cordyceps have been shown to reduce inflammation in the airways of mice, making them a potential therapy for asthma. However, the fungi appear to be less effective than commonly prescribed drugs used to provide relief for inflamed areas of the body (43Trusted Source).

Cordyceps may also have topical uses. One study found it reduced skin inflammation when applied topically in mice, further demonstrating its anti-inflammatory properties (44Trusted Source).

The potential inflammation-fighting properties of Cordyceps have yet to be observed in humans.

SUMMARY
Research suggests Cordyceps decrease inflammatory markers in animals. However, their effects on inflammation in humans remain unknown.

Taking Cordyceps Supplements
Cordyceps sinensis is difficult to harvest and carries a price tag of more than $9,000 USD per pound (32Trusted Source).

For this reason, the majority of Cordyceps supplements contain a synthetically grown version called Cordyceps CS-4.

To ensure you buy high-quality Cordyceps supplements, look for brands that carry the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) or NSF International (NSF) seal (45Trusted Source).

These are third-party organizations that ensure supplements contain the ingredients listed on the label, without impurities.

Dosages
Due to limited research in humans, there is no consensus on dosages.

The dosage commonly used in human research is 1,000–3,000 mg per day. This range is not associated with side effects and has been found to have certain health benefits.

Side Effects and Safety
No studies have yet examined the safety of Cordyceps in humans.

However, a long history of use in Traditional Chinese Medicine suggests they are nontoxic.

In fact, the Chinese government approved Cordyceps CS-4 for use in hospitals and recognizes it as a safe, natural drug (32Trusted Source).

SUMMARY
Cordyceps supplements are grown in labs due to the high costs of wild-harvested Cordyceps sinensis. Dosages in humans range from 1,000–3000 mg. There are currently no studies on their safety in humans.

The Bottom Line
Cordyceps are well known in Traditional Chinese Medicine and have been used for centuries to treat many health ailments.

Though the fungi show promise in many areas, there’s little research on their effects in humans. Thus, more research is needed before experts can make any recommendations.

Animal and lab studies suggest Cordyceps have the potential to improve heart health and fight inflammation, cancer, diabetes and aging. However, many of these studies are poor quality, and the results cannot be extended to humans.

Nevertheless, there have been human studies on Cordyceps’ effects on exercise performance. The fungi have been found to potentially boost energy and oxygen use during exercise.

Currently, there is no consensus on the dosage people should take to reap its potential health benefits, or how safe it is.

If you choose to take Cordyceps supplements, make sure they’ve been tested by a third-party organization for purity and quality.

Only time will tell if the health benefits of Cordyceps observed in animal and laboratory studies apply to humans.

6 Benefits of Reishi Mushroom (Plus Side Effects and Dosage)
Reishi mushrooms may benefit your immune and overall health. But they can cause digestive side effects and could potentially be unsafe for certain people, including those who may be pregnant.

Eastern medicine makes use of many different plants and fungi. Interestingly, the reishi mushroom is particularly popular.

It has a variety of potential health benefits, including boosting the immune system and fighting cancer. However, its safety has recently come into question.

This article will tell you what you need to know about the potential benefits and risks of reishi mushroom.

What Is the Reishi Mushroom?
The reishi mushroom, also known as Ganoderma lucidum and lingzhi, is a fungus that grows in various hot and humid locations in Asia (1Trusted Source).

For many years, this fungus has been a staple in Eastern medicine (1Trusted Source, 2Trusted Source).

Within the mushroom, there are several molecules, including triterpenoids, polysaccharides and peptidoglycans, that may be responsible for its health effects (3Trusted Source).

While the mushrooms themselves can be eaten fresh, it is also common to use powdered forms of the mushroom or extracts that contain these specific molecules.

These different forms have been tested in cell, animal and human studies.

Below are 6 scientifically studied benefits of the reishi mushroom. The first three are backed by stronger evidence, while support for the others is less conclusive.

1. Boost the Immune System
One of the most important effects of the reishi mushroom is that it can boost your immune system (4Trusted Source).

While some details are still uncertain, test-tube studies have shown that reishi can affect the genes in white blood cells, which are critical parts of your immune system.

What’s more, these studies have found that some forms of reishi may alter inflammation pathways in white blood cells (5Trusted Source).

Research in cancer patients has shown that some of the molecules found in the mushroom can increase the activity of a type of white blood cell called natural killer cells (6Trusted Source).

Natural killer cells fight infections and cancer in the body (7Trusted Source).

Another study found that reishi can increase the number of other white blood cells (lymphocytes) in those with colorectal cancer (2Trusted Source).

Although most immune system benefits of reishi mushroom have been seen in those who are ill, some evidence has shown that it can help healthy people, too.

In one study, the fungus improved lymphocyte function, which helps fight infections and cancer, in athletes exposed to stressful conditions (8Trusted Source, 9Trusted Source).

However, other research in healthy adults showed no improvement in immune function or inflammation after 4 weeks of taking reishi extract (10Trusted Source).

Overall, it is clear that reishi impacts white blood cells and immune function. More research is needed to determine the extent of the benefits in the healthy and ill.

Summary Reishi mushroom can
enhance immune function through its effects on white blood cells, which help
fight infection and cancer. This may occur primarily in those who are ill, as
mixed results have been seen in those who are healthy.

2. Anti-Cancer Properties
Many people consume this fungus due to its potential cancer-fighting properties (11, 12Trusted Source).

In fact, one study of over 4,000 breast cancer survivors found that around 59% consumed reishi mushroom (13Trusted Source).

Additionally, several test-tube studies have shown that it can lead to the death of cancer cells (14Trusted Source, 15Trusted Source, 16Trusted Source).

Yet the results of these studies do not necessarily equate to effectiveness in animals or humans.

Some research has investigated if reishi could be beneficial for prostate cancer due to its effects on the hormone testosterone (17, 18Trusted Source).

While one case study showed that molecules found in this mushroom may reverse prostate cancer in humans, a larger follow-up study did not support these findings (19Trusted Source, 20Trusted Source).

Reishi mushroom has also been studied for its role in preventing or fighting colorectal cancer (2Trusted Source, 21Trusted Source).

Some research showed that one year of treatment with reishi decreased the number and size of tumors in the large intestine (21Trusted Source).

What’s more, a detailed report of multiple studies indicated that the mushroom can beneficially affect cancer patients (22Trusted Source).

These benefits included increasing the activity of the body’s white blood cells, which help fight cancer, and improving quality of life in cancer patients.

However, researchers state that reishi should be administered in combination with traditional treatment rather than replacing it (22Trusted Source).

What’s more, many of the studies of reishi mushroom and cancer were not high-quality. Because of this, much more research is needed (11, 23Trusted Source).

Summary Although reishi
mushroom appears to hold some promise for cancer prevention or treatment, more
information is needed before it becomes part of standard therapy. However, it
may be appropriate to use in addition to normal care in some cases.

3. Could Fight Fatigue and Depression
Reishi’s effects on the immune system are often most emphasized, but it has other potential advantages as well.

These include reduced fatigue and depression, as well as improved quality of life.

One study examined its effects in 132 people with neurasthenia, a poorly defined condition associated with aches, pains, dizziness, headaches and irritability (24Trusted Source).

The researchers found that fatigue was reduced and well-being was improved after 8 weeks of taking the supplements.

Another study found that fatigue was reduced and quality of life was improved after 4 weeks of taking reishi powder in a group of 48 breast cancer survivors (25Trusted Source).

What’s more, the people in the study also experienced less anxiety and depression.

While reishi mushroom may hold promise for people with certain diseases or illnesses, it is not clear if it would benefit those who are otherwise healthy.

Summary Some preliminary
studies have shown that reishi mushroom could decrease anxiety and depression
as well as improve quality of life in those with certain medical conditions.

4–6. Other Potential Benefits
In addition to its effects on the immune system and quality of life, reishi mushroom has been studied for its potential to improve other aspects of health.

4. Heart Health
One 12-week study of 26 people showed that reishi mushroom may increase “good” HDL cholesterol and decrease triglycerides (26Trusted Source).

However, other research in healthy adults showed no improvement in these heart disease risk factors (10Trusted Source).

Moreover, a large analysis demonstrated no beneficial effects for heart health after examining five different studies containing around 400 people. The researchers found that consuming reishi mushroom for up to 16 weeks did not improve cholesterol (27Trusted Source).

Overall, more research is needed in regard to reishi mushrooms and heart health.

5. Blood Sugar Control
Several studies have indicated that molecules found in the reishi mushroom can decrease blood sugar in animals (28Trusted Source, 29Trusted Source).

Some preliminary research in humans reported similar findings (30).

However, the majority of research has not supported this benefit. After evaluating hundreds of participants, researchers found no benefits for fasting blood sugar (27Trusted Source).

Mixed results were seen for blood sugar after meals. In some cases, reishi mushroom lowered blood sugar, but in other cases, it was worse than a placebo.

Again, more research is needed here as well.

6. Antioxidant Status
Antioxidants are molecules that can help prevent damage to your cells (31).

Because of this important function, there is substantial interest in foods and supplements that can enhance antioxidant status in the body.

Many claim that reishi mushroom is effective for this purpose.

However, several studies have found no change in the levels of two important antioxidant enzymes in the blood after consuming the fungus for 4 to 12 weeks (10Trusted Source, 26Trusted Source).

Summary A small amount of
research has shown that reishi mushroom could improve good cholesterol or blood
sugar. However, the majority of the research indicates that it does not improve
cholesterol, blood sugar or antioxidants in the body.

Dosage Recommendations Vary Based on the Form Used
Unlike some foods or supplements, the dose of reishi mushroom can vary substantially based on which type is used (12Trusted Source).

The highest doses are seen when someone consumes the mushroom itself. In these cases, doses may range from 25 to 100 grams, depending on the size of the mushroom (32, 33).

Commonly, a dried extract of the mushroom is used instead. In these cases, the dose is approximately 10 times less than when the mushroom itself is consumed (10Trusted Source).

For example, 50 grams of reishi mushroom itself may be comparable to approximately 5 grams of the mushroom extract. Doses of the mushroom extract vary but typically range from approximately 1.5 to 9 grams per day (27Trusted Source).

Additionally, some supplements use only certain portions of the extract. In these cases, the recommended doses may be much lower than the values reported above.

Because the suggested dose can vary widely based on which form of the mushroom is used, it is very important to know which type you are taking.

Summary The dose of reishi mushroom varies based on the
form of the fungus, so it is important to know which form you are using.
Consuming the mushroom itself provides higher doses, while extracts provide
lower doses.

Possible Side Effects and Dangers
Despite its popularity, there are those who have questioned the safety of reishi mushroom.

Some research found that those who took reishi mushroom for 4 months were almost two times as likely to experience a side effect as those taking a placebo (22Trusted Source).

However, these effects were minor and included a slightly increased risk of upset stomach or digestive distress. No adverse effects on liver health were reported.

Other research also indicated that four weeks of taking reishi mushroom extract did not produce any detrimental effects on the liver or kidneys in healthy adults (10Trusted Source).

In contrast to these reports, significant liver problems have been reported in two case studies (34Trusted Source, 35Trusted Source).

Both of the people in the case studies had previously used reishi mushroom without problems but experienced adverse effects after switching to a powdered form.

This makes it difficult to know for certain if the mushroom itself was responsible for the observed liver damage or if there were problems with the powdered extract.

It is also important to note that many studies of reishi mushroom have not reported safety data, so limited information is available overall (22Trusted Source).

Nevertheless, there are several groups of people who should probably avoid reishi.

These include those who are pregnant or breastfeeding, have a blood disorder, will be undergoing surgery or have low blood pressure (36).

Summary Some studies of reishi
mushroom have not provided safety information, but others have reported that
several months of taking it is likely safe. Nonetheless, several cases of
severe liver damage have been associated with reishi extract.

The Bottom Line
Reishi mushroom is a popular fungus used in Eastern medicine.

It may boost the immune system through its effects on white blood cells, particularly in people who are ill, such as those with cancer.

This fungus may also be able to decrease the size and number of tumors in certain types of cancer, as well as improve quality of life for some cancer patients.

Most human research has shown that it does not improve cholesterol, blood sugar or antioxidants, but it may be effective at reducing fatigue or depression in some cases.

In test-tube studies, Cordyceps have been shown to inhibit the growth of many types of human cancer cells, including lung, colon, skin and liver cancers (18Trusted Source, 19Trusted Source, 20Trusted Source, 21Trusted Source).

Studies in mice have also shown that Cordyceps have anti-tumor effects on lymphoma, melanoma and lung cancer (22Trusted Source, 23Trusted Source, 24Trusted Source, 25Trusted Source).

Cordyceps may also reverse the side effects associated with many forms of cancer therapy. One of these side effects is leukopenia.

Not to be confused with the cancer leukemia, leukopenia is a condition in which the number of white blood cells (leukocytes) decreases, lowering the body’s defenses and increasing the risk of infection (26Trusted Source).

One study tested the effects of Cordyceps on mice that developed leukopenia after radiation and treatments with Taxol, a common chemotherapy drug (27Trusted Source).

Interestingly, Cordyceps reversed the leukopenia. These results suggest the fungi may help reduce complications associated with some cancer treatments.

However, it’s important to note that these studies were performed in animals and test tubes, not humans.

The effects of Cordyceps on leukopenia and tumor growth in humans is unknown, so health experts can’t currently draw conclusions.

SUMMARY
Test-tube and animal studies suggest Cordyceps may have the potential to treat cancer, as well as some side effects of cancer treatments. However, these effects have not been shown in humans, and more research is needed.


4. May Help Manage Type 2 Diabetes
Cordyceps contain a special type of sugar that may help treat diabetes.

Diabetes is a disease in which the body either does not produce or respond to the hormone insulin, which normally transports the sugar glucose into your cells for energy.

When your body does not produce enough insulin or respond well to it, glucose cannot enter the cells, so it stays in the blood. Over time, having too much glucose in the blood can cause serious health problems.

Therefore, it’s important for people with diabetes to make sure their blood sugar levels are well controlled.

Interestingly, Cordyceps may keep blood sugar levels within a healthy range by mimicking the action of insulin.

In several studies in diabetic mice, Cordyceps have been shown to decrease blood sugar levels (28Trusted Source, 29Trusted Source, 30Trusted Source).

Some evidence suggests that they may also protect against kidney disease, a common complication of diabetes.

In a review of 22 studies including 1,746 people with chronic kidney disease, those who took Cordyceps supplements experienced improved kidney function (31Trusted Source).

However, these results aren’t conclusive. The authors of the review stated that many of the studies were low quality. Therefore, no conclusions could be made about the effects of Cordyceps on kidney function in humans with chronic kidney disease.

SUMMARY
Chronically elevated blood sugar levels are common in people with uncontrolled diabetes and can have serious health effects. Research in animals suggests Cordyceps may have potential as a diabetes treatment.

5. Possible Benefits for Heart Health
As research emerges on the effects of Cordyceps on heart health, the benefits of the fungi are becoming increasingly apparent.

In fact, Cordyceps are approved in China for the treatment of arrhythmia, a condition in which the heartbeat is too slow, too fast or irregular (32Trusted Source).

A study found that Cordyceps significantly reduced heart injuries in rats with chronic kidney disease. Injuries to the heart from chronic kidney disease are thought to increase the risk of heart failure, so reducing these injuries may help avoid this outcome (33Trusted Source).

The researchers attributed these findings to the adenosine content of Cordyceps. Adenosine is a naturally occurring compound that has heart-protective effects (34Trusted Source).

Cordyceps may also have a beneficial effect on cholesterol levels.

Animal research has shown that Cordyceps decrease “bad” LDL cholesterol (35Trusted Source, 36Trusted Source, 37).

LDL can raise your risk of heart disease by leading to the buildup of cholesterol in your arteries.

Similarly, Cordyceps have been shown to decrease triglyceride levels in mice (35Trusted Source).

Triglycerides are a type of fat found in your blood. High levels are linked to a greater risk of heart disease (38Trusted Source).

Unfortunately, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether Cordyceps benefit heart health in humans.

SUMMARY
Cordyceps may benefit heart health by helping prevent arrhythmias and lowering levels of triglycerides and “bad” LDL cholesterol.


6. May Help Fight Inflammation
Cordyceps is said to help fight inflammation in the body.

Although some inflammation is good, too much can lead to diseases like heart disease and cancer.

Research has shown that when human cells are exposed to Cordyceps, special proteins that increase inflammation in the body become suppressed (39Trusted Source, 40Trusted Source, 41Trusted Source, 42Trusted Source).

Thanks to these potential effects, researchers believe Cordyceps may serve as a useful anti-inflammatory supplement or drug (42Trusted Source).

In fact, Cordyceps have been shown to reduce inflammation in the airways of mice, making them a potential therapy for asthma. However, the fungi appear to be less effective than commonly prescribed drugs used to provide relief for inflamed areas of the body (43Trusted Source).

Cordyceps may also have topical uses. One study found it reduced skin inflammation when applied topically in mice, further demonstrating its anti-inflammatory properties (44Trusted Source).

The potential inflammation-fighting properties of Cordyceps have yet to be observed in humans.

SUMMARY
Research suggests Cordyceps decrease inflammatory markers in animals. However, their effects on inflammation in humans remain unknown.

Taking Cordyceps Supplements
Cordyceps sinensis is difficult to harvest and carries a price tag of more than $9,000 USD per pound (32Trusted Source).

For this reason, the majority of Cordyceps supplements contain a synthetically grown version called Cordyceps CS-4.

To ensure you buy high-quality Cordyceps supplements, look for brands that carry the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) or NSF International (NSF) seal (45Trusted Source).

These are third-party organizations that ensure supplements contain the ingredients listed on the label, without impurities.

Dosages
Due to limited research in humans, there is no consensus on dosages.

The dosage commonly used in human research is 1,000–3,000 mg per day. This range is not associated with side effects and has been found to have certain health benefits.

Side Effects and Safety
No studies have yet examined the safety of Cordyceps in humans.

However, a long history of use in Traditional Chinese Medicine suggests they are nontoxic.

In fact, the Chinese government approved Cordyceps CS-4 for use in hospitals and recognizes it as a safe, natural drug (32Trusted Source).

SUMMARY
Cordyceps supplements are grown in labs due to the high costs of wild-harvested Cordyceps sinensis. Dosages in humans range from 1,000–3000 mg. There are currently no studies on their safety in humans.

The Bottom Line
Cordyceps are well known in Traditional Chinese Medicine and have been used for centuries to treat many health ailments.

Though the fungi show promise in many areas, there’s little research on their effects in humans. Thus, more research is needed before experts can make any recommendations.

Animal and lab studies suggest Cordyceps have the potential to improve heart health and fight inflammation, cancer, diabetes and aging. However, many of these studies are poor quality, and the results cannot be extended to humans.

Nevertheless, there have been human studies on Cordyceps’ effects on exercise performance. The fungi have been found to potentially boost energy and oxygen use during exercise.

Currently, there is no consensus on the dosage people should take to reap its potential health benefits, or how safe it is.

If you choose to take Cordyceps supplements, make sure they’ve been tested by a third-party organization for purity and quality.

Only time will tell if the health benefits of Cordyceps observed in animal and laboratory studies apply to humans.

6 Benefits of Reishi Mushroom (Plus Side Effects and Dosage)
Reishi mushrooms may benefit your immune and overall health. But they can cause digestive side effects and could potentially be unsafe for certain people, including those who may be pregnant.

Eastern medicine makes use of many different plants and fungi. Interestingly, the reishi mushroom is particularly popular.

It has a variety of potential health benefits, including boosting the immune system and fighting cancer. However, its safety has recently come into question.

This article will tell you what you need to know about the potential benefits and risks of reishi mushroom.

What Is the Reishi Mushroom?
The reishi mushroom, also known as Ganoderma lucidum and lingzhi, is a fungus that grows in various hot and humid locations in Asia (1Trusted Source).

For many years, this fungus has been a staple in Eastern medicine (1Trusted Source, 2Trusted Source).

Within the mushroom, there are several molecules, including triterpenoids, polysaccharides and peptidoglycans, that may be responsible for its health effects (3Trusted Source).

While the mushrooms themselves can be eaten fresh, it is also common to use powdered forms of the mushroom or extracts that contain these specific molecules.

These different forms have been tested in cell, animal and human studies.

Below are 6 scientifically studied benefits of the reishi mushroom. The first three are backed by stronger evidence, while support for the others is less conclusive.

1. Boost the Immune System
One of the most important effects of the reishi mushroom is that it can boost your immune system (4Trusted Source).

While some details are still uncertain, test-tube studies have shown that reishi can affect the genes in white blood cells, which are critical parts of your immune system.

What’s more, these studies have found that some forms of reishi may alter inflammation pathways in white blood cells (5Trusted Source).

Research in cancer patients has shown that some of the molecules found in the mushroom can increase the activity of a type of white blood cell called natural killer cells (6Trusted Source).

Natural killer cells fight infections and cancer in the body (7Trusted Source).

Another study found that reishi can increase the number of other white blood cells (lymphocytes) in those with colorectal cancer (2Trusted Source).

Although most immune system benefits of reishi mushroom have been seen in those who are ill, some evidence has shown that it can help healthy people, too.

In one study, the fungus improved lymphocyte function, which helps fight infections and cancer, in athletes exposed to stressful conditions (8Trusted Source, 9Trusted Source).

However, other research in healthy adults showed no improvement in immune function or inflammation after 4 weeks of taking reishi extract (10Trusted Source).

Overall, it is clear that reishi impacts white blood cells and immune function. More research is needed to determine the extent of the benefits in the healthy and ill.

Summary Reishi mushroom can
enhance immune function through its effects on white blood cells, which help
fight infection and cancer. This may occur primarily in those who are ill, as
mixed results have been seen in those who are healthy.

2. Anti-Cancer Properties
Many people consume this fungus due to its potential cancer-fighting properties (11, 12Trusted Source).

In fact, one study of over 4,000 breast cancer survivors found that around 59% consumed reishi mushroom (13Trusted Source).

Additionally, several test-tube studies have shown that it can lead to the death of cancer cells (14Trusted Source, 15Trusted Source, 16Trusted Source).

Yet the results of these studies do not necessarily equate to effectiveness in animals or humans.

Some research has investigated if reishi could be beneficial for prostate cancer due to its effects on the hormone testosterone (17, 18Trusted Source).

While one case study showed that molecules found in this mushroom may reverse prostate cancer in humans, a larger follow-up study did not support these findings (19Trusted Source, 20Trusted Source).

Reishi mushroom has also been studied for its role in preventing or fighting colorectal cancer (2Trusted Source, 21Trusted Source).

Some research showed that one year of treatment with reishi decreased the number and size of tumors in the large intestine (21Trusted Source).

What’s more, a detailed report of multiple studies indicated that the mushroom can beneficially affect cancer patients (22Trusted Source).

These benefits included increasing the activity of the body’s white blood cells, which help fight cancer, and improving quality of life in cancer patients.

However, researchers state that reishi should be administered in combination with traditional treatment rather than replacing it (22Trusted Source).

What’s more, many of the studies of reishi mushroom and cancer were not high-quality. Because of this, much more research is needed (11, 23Trusted Source).

Summary Although reishi
mushroom appears to hold some promise for cancer prevention or treatment, more
information is needed before it becomes part of standard therapy. However, it
may be appropriate to use in addition to normal care in some cases.

3. Could Fight Fatigue and Depression
Reishi’s effects on the immune system are often most emphasized, but it has other potential advantages as well.

These include reduced fatigue and depression, as well as improved quality of life.

One study examined its effects in 132 people with neurasthenia, a poorly defined condition associated with aches, pains, dizziness, headaches and irritability (24Trusted Source).

The researchers found that fatigue was reduced and well-being was improved after 8 weeks of taking the supplements.

Another study found that fatigue was reduced and quality of life was improved after 4 weeks of taking reishi powder in a group of 48 breast cancer survivors (25Trusted Source).

What’s more, the people in the study also experienced less anxiety and depression.

While reishi mushroom may hold promise for people with certain diseases or illnesses, it is not clear if it would benefit those who are otherwise healthy.

Summary Some preliminary
studies have shown that reishi mushroom could decrease anxiety and depression
as well as improve quality of life in those with certain medical conditions.

4–6. Other Potential Benefits
In addition to its effects on the immune system and quality of life, reishi mushroom has been studied for its potential to improve other aspects of health.

4. Heart Health
One 12-week study of 26 people showed that reishi mushroom may increase “good” HDL cholesterol and decrease triglycerides (26Trusted Source).

However, other research in healthy adults showed no improvement in these heart disease risk factors (10Trusted Source).

Moreover, a large analysis demonstrated no beneficial effects for heart health after examining five different studies containing around 400 people. The researchers found that consuming reishi mushroom for up to 16 weeks did not improve cholesterol (27Trusted Source).

Overall, more research is needed in regard to reishi mushrooms and heart health.

5. Blood Sugar Control
Several studies have indicated that molecules found in the reishi mushroom can decrease blood sugar in animals (28Trusted Source, 29Trusted Source).

Some preliminary research in humans reported similar findings (30).

However, the majority of research has not supported this benefit. After evaluating hundreds of participants, researchers found no benefits for fasting blood sugar (27Trusted Source).

Mixed results were seen for blood sugar after meals. In some cases, reishi mushroom lowered blood sugar, but in other cases, it was worse than a placebo.

Again, more research is needed here as well.

6. Antioxidant Status
Antioxidants are molecules that can help prevent damage to your cells (31).

Because of this important function, there is substantial interest in foods and supplements that can enhance antioxidant status in the body.

Many claim that reishi mushroom is effective for this purpose.

However, several studies have found no change in the levels of two important antioxidant enzymes in the blood after consuming the fungus for 4 to 12 weeks (10Trusted Source, 26Trusted Source).

Summary A small amount of
research has shown that reishi mushroom could improve good cholesterol or blood
sugar. However, the majority of the research indicates that it does not improve
cholesterol, blood sugar or antioxidants in the body.

Dosage Recommendations Vary Based on the Form Used
Unlike some foods or supplements, the dose of reishi mushroom can vary substantially based on which type is used (12Trusted Source).

The highest doses are seen when someone consumes the mushroom itself. In these cases, doses may range from 25 to 100 grams, depending on the size of the mushroom (32, 33).

Commonly, a dried extract of the mushroom is used instead. In these cases, the dose is approximately 10 times less than when the mushroom itself is consumed (10Trusted Source).

For example, 50 grams of reishi mushroom itself may be comparable to approximately 5 grams of the mushroom extract. Doses of the mushroom extract vary but typically range from approximately 1.5 to 9 grams per day (27Trusted Source).

Additionally, some supplements use only certain portions of the extract. In these cases, the recommended doses may be much lower than the values reported above.

Because the suggested dose can vary widely based on which form of the mushroom is used, it is very important to know which type you are taking.

Summary The dose of reishi mushroom varies based on the
form of the fungus, so it is important to know which form you are using.
Consuming the mushroom itself provides higher doses, while extracts provide
lower doses.

Possible Side Effects and Dangers
Despite its popularity, there are those who have questioned the safety of reishi mushroom.

Some research found that those who took reishi mushroom for 4 months were almost two times as likely to experience a side effect as those taking a placebo (22Trusted Source).

However, these effects were minor and included a slightly increased risk of upset stomach or digestive distress. No adverse effects on liver health were reported.

Other research also indicated that four weeks of taking reishi mushroom extract did not produce any detrimental effects on the liver or kidneys in healthy adults (10Trusted Source).

In contrast to these reports, significant liver problems have been reported in two case studies (34Trusted Source, 35Trusted Source).

Both of the people in the case studies had previously used reishi mushroom without problems but experienced adverse effects after switching to a powdered form.

This makes it difficult to know for certain if the mushroom itself was responsible for the observed liver damage or if there were problems with the powdered extract.

It is also important to note that many studies of reishi mushroom have not reported safety data, so limited information is available overall (22Trusted Source).

Nevertheless, there are several groups of people who should probably avoid reishi.

These include those who are pregnant or breastfeeding, have a blood disorder, will be undergoing surgery or have low blood pressure (36).

Summary Some studies of reishi
mushroom have not provided safety information, but others have reported that
several months of taking it is likely safe. Nonetheless, several cases of
severe liver damage have been associated with reishi extract.

The Bottom Line
Reishi mushroom is a popular fungus used in Eastern medicine.

It may boost the immune system through its effects on white blood cells, particularly in people who are ill, such as those with cancer.

This fungus may also be able to decrease the size and number of tumors in certain types of cancer, as well as improve quality of life for some cancer patients.

Most human research has shown that it does not improve cholesterol, blood sugar or antioxidants, but it may be effective at reducing fatigue or depression in some cases.
